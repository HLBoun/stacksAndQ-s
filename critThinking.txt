Requirements:

  Create template
  Create a class that uses said template
  template should make a static stack of any datatype
  Driver related program.


First Thoughts:

  Should be fairly straight forward. Include <stack>
  , it should fit any data type (maybe excluding strings).

  Steps:
    
    0.) At the top of the paper goes my name...with the date!
    1.) Include <stack>
    2.) create a class 'template' that templates stacks
    3.) verify .push() functions and such.


Notes:
  
  I did learn the difference between using a static stack
  and using a dynamic stack is kind of pointer based??
  Will have to read more about it. I don't know exactly why
  , but I do know how to recreate it. 
  
  For example:
    Stack *pointer = new stack();
