Requirements:

  Create a class template
  template should make a static stack of any kind
  Driver program.


First Thoughts:

  Should be fairly straight forward. Include <stack>
  , it should fit any data type (maybe excluding strings).

  Steps:
    
    0.) At the top of the paper goes my name...with the date!
    1.) Include <stack>
    2.) create a class 'template' that templates stacks
    3.) verify .push() functions and such.
